    <h1 style="font-size: 20px">1. Best Drought-Tolerant Indoor Plant : Philodendron</h1>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c0/27/f0/c027f0b9284c93b92d0a35611785f32e.jpg" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto;" >
    <p align="justify">
        What's not to like about philodendrons? Their name is derived from the Greek words philo-, which means "love," and dendron — the word for "tree." Most types of Philodendron can tolerate dark corners and very little watering. "They like to be on the dry side," says Sharon Nejman, Senior Horticulturist at Chicago Botanic Garden, so don't fill the watering can more than once per week.

    <p align="justify">
        Also known as Aglaonema, the Chinese Evergreen is a great pick if you're looking for a trouble-free houseplant, providing you follow proper growing conditions. It only needs watering every 5 to 10 days (watch out for soggy soil) and low to bright indirect sunlight to keep it intact. You can find varieties with green leaves adorned in bold stripes ranging from silver to red.

    <p align="justify">
        What's better than one spider plant? Multiple spider plants. The fast-growing shoots produce little "babies" that you can re-pot for added greenery elsewhere. Just stick to well-lit spots, and don't forget weekly watering.
